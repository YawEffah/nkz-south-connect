                        <p>
                            The National Democratic Congress (NDC) is a social democratic political party in Ghana, 
                            founded by Jerry Rawlings, who was Head of State in Ghana from 1981 to 1993. He became the 
                            President of Ghana from 1993 to 2001. Following the formation of the Provisional National 
                            Defence Council (PNDC), which ruled Ghana following the military coup d'Ã©tat on 31 December 1981,
                            there was pressure from the international community to restore democracy. The NDC was formed as 
                            the ruling party ahead of elections in 1992, in which Rawlings was elected president, and in 1996 
                            Rawlings was re-elected as the NDC candidate. Rawlings' second term ended in 2001.
                            The NDC lost the presidency in the 2000 election, and it was not until the 2008 election, that they 
                            regained it with John Atta Mills as its candidate. They established the 1992 constitution of Ghana.

                            The NDC party symbol is an umbrella with the head of a dove at the tip. The party colors are red, white, green, 
                            and black, with the party slogan or motto as "Unity, stability, and development." Internationally, the NDC is a 
                            member of the Progressive Alliance and Socialist International. <br>               
                            On 9 December 2012, the Electoral Commission of Ghana declared NDC candidate John Dramani Mahama to be president-elect 
                            after a hotly contested race in which he won 50.7% of the votes cast.
